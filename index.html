            <p>I have a deep love for helping people learn more about themselves on their path to healing and wholeness.</p>
            <p>I have over 20 years of professional experience in healing fields- as a licensed clinical social worker (therapist), minister, spiritual health practitioner/educator, and meditation teacher. I utilize these fields and influences to offer holistic care.</p>
            <p>I utilize a client-centered approach, building on the strengths present and underlying in the persons I support. I believe that people have within them what they need to grow, and through our work together we will focus on removing barriers to help these elements come forward. </p>
            <p>I have an expansive understanding and appreciation of spirituality and support people based on their particular values. I utilize contemplative practices, like meditation, when helpful to clients. I also draw from emotion-based, cognitive, and experiential modalities. I believe that warmth and good relationship are critical to the therapeutic process. </p>
